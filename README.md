Lab0: Setting up github and self-introduction
## Intro!
Please provide a brief self-introduction below (year, hometown, favorite food, anything you would like to share with us!) to help us get to know you a little better :) 


My name is Kevin Le! I'm a first year Master's student with DSI. I was born in Ottawa, Canada, but grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area for the vast majority of my life. I'm passionate about soccer, music, and world cultures! I recently started learning how to DJ, which is exciting on top with all the data science stuff I'll learn in the next year.
